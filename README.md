# Studen_Project_Allocation


The algorithm assigns projects to students, given preferences of students for projects. The idea is to maximize the total project allocation satisfaction.

There are several algorithms which try to approximate the optimal combination of student - project pairs.
For example, you can find here an implementation of Abraham et al's (2007) algorithm for allocation of student projects. See Abraham et al (2007):
